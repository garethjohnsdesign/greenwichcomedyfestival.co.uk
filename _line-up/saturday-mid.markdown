David O’Doherty — The Ryanair Enya, The Lidl Bublé — returns to the stunning National Maritime Museum to headline the Big Top with talking and songs played on his crappy keyboard from 1986. A bona-fide favourite of the festival, expect a hit-packed set from this ‘8 Out Of 10 Cats Does Countdown’ regular.
