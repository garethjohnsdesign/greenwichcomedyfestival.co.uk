### Celebrating its 10th anniversary with a spell-binding selection of award-winning stand-ups, this year’s Greenwich Comedy Festival is not to be missed.

Once again the beautiful surroundings of the iconic [National Maritime Museum](https://www.rmg.co.uk/national-maritime-museum) in Royal Greenwich will be awash with even more legendary line-ups in the Big Top.

Marking a decade of laughter, we are ecstatic to announce an astounding programme featuring stand-up mega-star [Russell Howard](/line-up/sunday-late/), who performed at the inaugural event back in 2009, plus cult-hero [Adam Buxton](/line-up/sunday-early/), observational master [Ed Byrne](/line-up/saturday-mid/), one-liner slinger [Milton Jones](/line-up/saturday-early/), groundbreaking ventriloquist [Nina Conti](/line-up/saturday-mid/), self-styled ‘German Comedy Ambassador’ [Henning Wehn](/line-up/sunday-mid/), acclaimed character comic [Lolly Adefope](/line-up/thursday/), [David O’Doherty](/line-up/friday/), [Reginald D Hunter](/line-up/saturday-late/), [Shappi Khorsandi](/line-up/saturday-early/), [Nish Kumar](/line-up/thursday/) and many (many) more.
