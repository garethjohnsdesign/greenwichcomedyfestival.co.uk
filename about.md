The magnificent Greenwich Comedy Festival returns with its annual cavalcade of the very best comedians of the moment including TV mega-stars like The Last Leg’s JOSH WIDDICOMBE, British Comedy Award winner SEAN LOCK, the multi-award winning SARA PASCOE and master observationalist JASON MANFORD, alt-comedy heroes like Rose d’Or winner BRIDGET CHRISTIE and cult poet/comic and Alan Partridge side-kick TIM KEY.

Trailblazers like The Mash Report’s NISH KUMAR and festival favourite REGINALD D HUNTER can be seen plus grouchy genius RICH HALL, groundbreaking ventriloquist NINA CONTI, the crappy keyboard wielding DAVID O’DOHERTY and many fast-rising wonders like PHIL WANG, ROSIE JONES, OLGA KOCH and LARRY DEAN.

Now in its eleventh year this comedy extravaganza pairs award-winning entertainment in the Big Top with a boutique-style festival complete with bars serving craft beers and summer-inspired cocktails plus delicious bites from the leading lights of the street-food scene.
