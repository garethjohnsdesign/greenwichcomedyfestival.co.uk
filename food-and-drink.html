<li>title: Melter Meatballs
image: &#8220;/uploads/melter-meatballs.jpg&#8221;
description: When it comes to serving up mighty balls of meat, there&#8217;s no one out there quite like Melter Meatballs! These guys pride themselves on serving up the very best you&#8217;ll find in London and once you&#8217;ve tasted them, we&#8217;re sure that you&#8217;ll agree. Their prime beef, minced chicken and pork are locally sourced from the five-star rated Smithfield Butchers located in Central London so the provenance couldn&#8217;t be any better. Each giant meatball is hand-rolled and lovingly stuffed with their very own secret herb mix. All you have to do is choose your balls - juicy beef in a slow-cooked cheesy marinara sauce, chicken meatballs roasted in a buffalo hot sauce or our hoisin smothered pork meatballs filled with Chinese five spice. Then you get to choose your base, fresh brioche, buttery or truffle mash, spaghetti, salad or have them on their own. If you thought they had finished there, then think again, you can then top them off with truffle mayonnaise, blue cheese dip, chilli jam, crispy onions, parmesan and red slaw!
