    This year’s festival will be bursting with a great range of bars and a hand-picked selection of food vendors including The Big V's legendary vegan burger bar, succulent & spicy Jerk Chicken from S Class Food, Warm & Toastie will be peddling their passions for the Great British Cheese Toastie plus wraps, salads, triple-dipped chips, award-winning coffee and lots more to keep your bouche-amused between the shows!

    Our street-food stalls may only accept cash.

    Pre-order your interval drinks! Jump the bar queue during the interval by being all high-tech with [Ordoo](http://ordoo.co.uk), a clever little app that let’s you pre-order and pay for your drinks. Just download the [app](http://ordoo.co.uk), fill in your payment details and order a round of drinks to collect from the pick-up point at the bar. Ordoo will tell you when your drinks are ready so there’s no need to hang around. Spend your interval enjoying a pint and having a chuckle with your mates rather than standing in line!

    Join our Front of House Team and get in on all the comedy action. You’ll be the first point of contact with our audience so good communication skills and a friendly attitude are a must. Working with our Front of House Manager you’ll be responsible for getting everyone to the right place at the right time, making sure the shows run on time and keeping the venues running smoothly. You should be confident, good with people, alert and interested in the festival you’re representing. This role is very active and a lot of fun, you should enjoy dealing with lots of people and manage all this with a level head. This is an unpaid volunteer role. You will be given food vouchers to use at our street-food stalls and as many (non-alcoholic) drinks as you need.

    You will be expected to work at least four shifts throughout the festival (13th to 17th Sept). Each shift lasts about four hours with breaks. You must be over 16.

    If you’re interested please send your name and contact details to hannah@57festivals.com with FRONT OF HOUSE TEAM in the subject line.
