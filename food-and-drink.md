  description: Kwackers is all about the duck. They serve up delicious food that is
    all based around the popular aromatic crispy duck that everyone knows and loves,
    all from their super cool event set-up. Their very own 5oz duck burgers served
    in a toasted brioche bun with hoisin onions and a zesty cucumber salad are unbelievably
    good! They serve this burger alongside their epic double cooked duck fat chips,
    which are so crispy and tasty that they almost overshadow the burger itself! They
    can also serve crispy duck wraps and they can even serve half a crispy duck with
    hoisin sauce and pancakes!

  description: The 3 Little Pigs Souvlaki philosophy is to use time honoured cooking
    methods, family recipes and quality produce to make real food with integrity and
    taste – something that is missing from the Greek/London street food scene. With
    25 years’ experience in the customer service and food-service management industry,
    the time is right to introduce London to The 3 Little Pigs and allow it to experience
    a tradition that has combined an amazing childhood memory, traditional cooking
    techniques and a love of BBQ.
