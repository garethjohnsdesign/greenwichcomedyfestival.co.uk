  description: When it comes to serving up mighty balls of meat, there's no one out
    there quite like Melter Meatballs! These guys pride themselves on serving up the
    very best you'll find in London and once you've tasted them, we're sure that you'll
    agree. Their prime beef, minced chicken and pork are locally sourced from the
    five-star rated Smithfield Butchers located in Central London so the provenance
    couldn't be any better. Each giant meatball is hand-rolled and lovingly stuffed
    with their very own secret herb mix. All you have to do is choose your balls -
    juicy beef in a slow-cooked cheesy marinara sauce, chicken meatballs roasted in
    a buffalo hot sauce or our hoisin smothered pork meatballs filled with Chinese
    five spice. Then you get to choose your base, fresh brioche, buttery or truffle
    mash, spaghetti, salad or have them on their own. If you thought they had finished
    there, then think again, you can then top them off with truffle mayonnaise, blue
    cheese dip, chilli jam, crispy onions, parmesan and red slaw!
