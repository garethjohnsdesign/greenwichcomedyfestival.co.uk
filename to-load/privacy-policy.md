Our privacy policy is pretty simple. 

We keep the email addresses of anyone who signs up to our mailing list via our website or has bought tickets to the festival. We don't keep any other information such as name or address - just the email. 

We use these emails to send out information about the upcoming festival. If you want to unsubscribe or change your email at any time please click this option at the bottom of every email that we issue.

Email addresses are stored with MailChimp, which is fully compliant with the latest data protection laws and makes it easy for us to protect and delete the contact information for any of our subscribers. 

We will never share, sell, rent or trade your personal information to any third parties for marketing purposes without your prior consent.  

We only sell our tickets through certified third-party ticket-sellers, such as See Tickets, Ticketmaster and Billeto. Each of the companies we use have their own privacy policies which are in compliance with relevant legislation. These companies provide us with the email addresses of ticket-buyers to our event to add to our mailing list. They do not provide us with any other information, and ticket-buyers are free to remove this information from our lists at any time, by unsubscribing. 

We are not responsible for any of the information gathered and stored by third-party sellers and enquiries related to information gathered at the time of ticket purchases should be directed to the relevant company.
